# Material3Playground
Desktop Playground to check how changing the color system can affect the different components in Material 3. Mainly used to learn and to get an overview of the Material 3 design components.

## Setup üîß

You can visit the release pages to download the .dmg file for Mac and install it locally.

If you want to check out the code, you can clone the project with `git clone git@github.com:oas004/Material3Playground.git`. Make sure that you are running a JDK version higher than 15. You can run the application either by running `./gradlew run` or pressing the play gutter icon button in the `Main.kt` file.

## Gameplay üî•

### UI Mode

You can toggle the UI Mode in the window menu bar at the top left. This will update all the colors to the dark/light theme.

| Light Mode                                                |                        Dark Mode                        | 
|-----------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------:|

You can interact with the components as you would on a mobile application. However, note that this is build with compose for desktop and there will be some differences on mobile.

### Interaction üåª
You can interact with the colors on the right side. If you press a color, you can change the hexcode for this color. Pressing the "OK" button will update the components with the new color.

For instance changing the primary color to pink will update the main display with pink as primary color like this:

The second time you change this color, the pink color will be remembered as a recently used color.

## Upcoming features üë∑
 - We are planing to be able to export the colors to a simple format.
 - We are still missing some key components from Material 3. We are planing on adding them. If there are someone that you miss, please file an issue or even better; make a PR on it.
